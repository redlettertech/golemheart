# Overview

## About

{% hint style="info" %}
**Fun Fact:** The name and artwork for GolemHeart were inspired by it's namesake magic card, [Golem's Heart](https://scryfall.com/card/som/161/golems-heart). Similar to the card's flavor text, GolemHeart's functionality is designed to "give life" to MTG Discord communities.

> _The heart of a golem gives life to more than just the iron husk around it._

GolemHeart is an open-source Discord bot designed to enhance public or private MTG Discord communities. GolemHeart's features are designed to encourage members to brew decks together, make it easier to play together online, and increase engagement in your community.
