# Getting Started

## [Invite the Bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=910268254453391410\&permissions=405874764800\&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You must have _Manage Server_ permissions to invite the bot to your Discord server and run the setup. The bot may not work properly if you uncheck any of the items on the authorization screen.
{% endhint %}

To install GolemHeart on your Discord Server, [**click here**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=910268254453391410\&permissions=405874764800\&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

## Setup GolemHeart

A couple of GolemHeart's commands require a bit of setup before they can be used. If you do not want one or both of these commands available to users on your server, you can safely skip the setup for those commands.

## Companion Bots

GolemHeart shines the most when used in combination with the following bots:

* ****[**SpellBot**](https://spellbot.io) **-** Allows starting SpellTable games from chat
* ****[**Scryfall**](https://scryfall.com/bots) **-** Allows linking cards in brewing threads
* ****[**RulesLawyer**](https://www.ruleslawyer.app/bots) **-** Allows linking rules in chat

Use of these bots is not required for GolemHeart to function properly, but they will help to enhance your server's MTG experience.
