# GolemHeart

## About

{% hint style="info" %}
**Fun Fact:** The name and artwork for GolemHeart were inspired by it's namesake magic card, [Golem's Heart](https://scryfall.com/card/som/161/golems-heart). Similar to the card's flavor text, GolemHeart's functionality is designed to "give life" to MTG Discord communities.
